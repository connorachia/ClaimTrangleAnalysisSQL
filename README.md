## ðŸ“Š Claims Triangle Analysis SQL Project

This project analyzes insurance claims data using a cumulative claims development triangle to estimate future claim liabilities. The steps included:

- Importing raw claims data from a SQLite database
- Pivoting the data into a standard triangle format (accident year Ã— development year)
- Calculating link ratios to understand claims development patterns
- Projecting future claim values and estimating IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported)
- Visualizing the completed triangle as a heatmap
